        <h1>Heal_N_Hale Services Society Grant  --  FAQ</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>How to respond to an organization without a charitable number?</h2>
        <p>You do not need to be a registered charity to apply for a grant; not-for-profit organizations are eligible.  It is up to you whether you apply through a charitable or non-profit organization. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>We are not a new program but a successful program over the past two years. Does this fall into your guidelines?</li>
            <li>We are considering applying for one of your grants for a project we recently piloted.  Are the grants applicable for projects that are already in existence?</li>
            <li>Are you considering only new projects or will you fund the continuation of an existing nutritional program?  </li>
        </ol>
        <p>H_N_H will be considering applications for projects and programs that have not yet started as well as continuing ventures, and we would be happy to consider your application.</p>
        <h2>Your website says that i.e., $ 20,000 will be awarded this year, with grants of up to i.e., $ 5,000 each. It sounds like just a few grants will be awarded provincially and this may be quite competitive.  We provide a regional service that does not cover all of BC – would it still be worthwhile for us to apply for this program, given how competitive it may be?</h2>
        <p>Yes. The criteria for awarding grants is based on the overall benefit of the program and not based solely on one aspect.</p>
        <h2>The Grant Application information provided notes a quarterly budget – does that mean that the funds will be disbursed quarterly?</h2>
        <p>No, the funds will not be distributed quarterly</p>
        <h2>The H_N_H Grant Applications notes the total funding available is i.e.,$14,000 with no less than i.e., $5000 per grant awarded. Will you consider applications for less than i.e., $5000 or does the foundation prefer to fund one or two larger projects?</h2>
        <p>If you have needs for a smaller project, please still apply.  We set the minimum more for the benefit of the applicants and so they could gauge whether it was worth it for them to apply.</p>
